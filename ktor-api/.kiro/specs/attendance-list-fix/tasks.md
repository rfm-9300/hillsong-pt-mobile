# Implementation Plan

- [ ] 1. Analyze the HTML structure error in AttendanceList.svelte
  - Examine the code around line 948 to identify the unmatched closing div tag
  - Map out the HTML structure to understand the proper nesting
  - Determine whether the issue is an extra closing tag or a missing opening tag
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 2.2_

- [ ] 2. Fix the HTML structure error
  - [ ] 2.1 Correct the unmatched closing div tag at line 948
    - Remove the extra closing tag or add a missing opening tag as needed
    - Ensure proper nesting of HTML elements
    - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 2.2_
  
  - [ ] 2.2 Review and clean up surrounding code
    - Check for proper indentation and formatting
    - Ensure consistent structure in similar sections
    - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.3_

- [ ] 3. Test the fixed component
  - [ ] 3.1 Verify the component renders without errors
    - Load the attendance event page and check for HTML structure errors
    - Verify that the page displays correctly
    - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.3, 3.1_
  
  - [ ] 3.2 Test component functionality
    - Test filtering and sorting functionality
    - Test check-in and check-out operations
    - Test status updates and notes editing
    - _Requirements: 1.3, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4_
  
  - [ ] 3.3 Test responsive design
    - Verify the component displays correctly on different screen sizes
    - Test mobile view functionality
    - _Requirements: 1.4, 3.5_

- [ ] 4. Document the fix
  - [ ] 4.1 Add comments to explain complex sections
    - Identify areas that might be confusing or complex
    - Add clear, concise comments to explain the purpose and structure
    - _Requirements: 2.3, 2.4_
  
  - [ ] 4.2 Update any relevant documentation
    - Document the fix in code comments or commit messages
    - Update any component documentation if it exists
    - _Requirements: 2.3, 2.4_

- [ ] 5. Final review and optimization
  - [ ] 5.1 Perform a final code review
    - Check for any remaining HTML structure issues
    - Verify code quality and readability
    - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3_
  
  - [ ] 5.2 Look for optimization opportunities
    - Identify any code that could be simplified or improved
    - Make minor optimizations if they don't risk introducing new issues
    - _Requirements: 2.3, 3.5_
